3.Handling missing values.

# Analysis Tasks
1. Employee Distribution by Team : Counted the number of employees per team & Calculated the percentage split relative to the total dataset.

2. Segregation by Position : Counted the number of employees in each position (PG, SG, SF, PF, C).

3. Predominant Age Group : Binned ages into groups to identify the most common age range.
